# Cement-composite-prediction-model
## AIM OF THE PROJECT 
### To Predict Ultimate compressive strenght of Cement Composite mixture using Machine Learning Technique.

## Summary of the Project
Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to predict the ultimate compressive strength of cement composite mixtures using machine learning techniques. This prediction helps in optimizing cement formulations for better structural integrity in construction applications. By leveraging data-driven insights, the project aims to enhance the efficiency of material selection and ensure cost-effective yet durable concrete compositions.

Dataset:
The dataset consists of multiple features representing different components of cement composite mixtures, such as:
Cement
Water
Aggregates
Additives
These variables significantly influence the compressive strength of the final mixture. Proper data preprocessing was performed, including handling missing values, feature scaling, and data normalization.

Techniques Applied:
To achieve accurate predictions, the following machine learning techniques were used:
‚úÖ Linear Regression: Implemented as a baseline model to understand relationships between input features and output strength.
‚úÖ Artificial Neural Network (ANN): Applied a deep learning model to capture complex non-linear patterns within the dataset. ANN was optimized through hyperparameter tuning, including adjustments in the number of layers, neurons, activation functions, and learning rate.
‚úÖ MinMaxScaler: Used to normalize the input features, ensuring that all variables contributed equally to model learning.
‚úÖ Model Evaluation: Metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R¬≤ Score were used to assess model performance.

Performance & Results:
The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model outperformed Linear Regression, demonstrating a higher prediction accuracy.
The model achieved an R¬≤ score of 0.88, indicating that 88% of the variance in compressive strength is explained by the input features.
The low error rates confirm that the model is well-suited for predicting cement strength with high reliability.

Key Outcomes & Future Scope:
This model provides a data-driven approach for optimizing cement formulations, reducing material costs while maintaining structural strength.

This project successfully demonstrates how machine learning and deep learning techniques can revolutionize material science and construction engineering. üöÄ
